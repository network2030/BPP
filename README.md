# BPP

This repository contains material about BPP, the "Big Packet Protocol" that is a precursor of New IP and the basis for New IP's concept of "contract collateral".  

The files include
- A Tutorial on BPP, given at IEEE/IFIP 2019 International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, Washington DC, USA, April 2019.
- The initial paper introducing BPP: R.Li, A. Clemm, U. Chunduri, L. Dong, K. Makhijani: "A New Framework and Protocol for Future Networking Applications."  ACM SIGCOMM 2018 Workshop on Networking for Emerging Applications and Technologies (NEAT), Budapest, Hungary, August 2018.  
- A paper describing how BPP can be used to provide high-precision communication services with stringent in-time and on-time latency objectives:  A. Clemm, T. Eckert: "High-Precision Latency Forwrding over Packet-Programmable Networks."  IEEE/IFIP 2020 Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), Budapest, Hungary / virtual, April 2020.
- A paper describing how BPP can be used for the purposes of Operational Flow Profiling to provide smarter network telemetry: A. Clemm, U. Chunduri: "Network-Programmable Operational Flow Profililng."  IEEE Communications Magazine Vol 57 No 7, July 2019
- An invited presentation describing how we need to think about reusing packet headers for services across layers in myltilayered networks: T.Eckert, S.Bryant "Unified Forwarding Plane for Enhanced Services", IEEE ICNP 2020 NIPAA Workshop, October 2020
